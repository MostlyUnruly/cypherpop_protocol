\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 [Intro]\
They was never on the stack, now they poppin\'92 up \'97 fake cache\
Tried to fork my path, but I reroute fast \'97 syntax clash\
\
[Verse 1]\
They smile in your @decorator, but snake in recursion\
Act like they linked, but they break on each version\
Tryna import love, but they missing the module\
Had to raise exceptions \'97 yeah, the vibe turned volatile\
Venom in they bytes, tryna slither through my function\
Said they down to ride, but ghosted at the junction\
I stay threaded up, parallel in my precision\
They just run loops \'97 stuck in indecision\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
You was just a try block, couldn\'92t catch the fall\
Talkin\'92 loyalty, but your class too small\
Wrapped in lies like a tuple in disguise\
But I got eyes like print(traceback), no surprise\
\
[Chorus]\
Snakes in the grass, I code in Python\
Fangs in the code, loyalty\'92s a bygone\
Printin\'92 red flags like it\'92s stderr\
But I still let you run like I didn\'92t care\
\
[Verse 2]\
def loyalty(): \'97 yeah, you failed the test\
-Now I del() that bond, clean up the mess\
I don\'92t yield, I don\'92t bend, I assert my path\
You a while True loop \'97 all fake, no math\
\
Swore you was static, but you acted dynamic\
Changed on the fly, now the vibes feel manic\
I got a blacklist longer than my Git commits\
You was snake.charmer(), I was blind to the script\
I debugged your whole persona \'97 breakpoints everywhere\
Steppin\'92 through your lies, saw NoneType in your stare\
No scope, no depth, your code don\'92t even compile\
Said you ride or die \'97 but you raised ValueError\
\
They try to clone the repo, but my soul ain\'92t open-source\
You can pip install the drip, but you can\'92t run my course\
I built this with venv \'97 solo grind in silence\
Now I chmod +x my trust \'97 no compliance\
\
[Bridge]\
Snakes in the grass, but I shed that skin\
New release, no bugs, let the real ones in\
You was False, I was boolean strong\
Now I raise LoyaltyError when the vibe feels wrong\
\
[Pre Chorus]\
Snakes in the grass \'97 I code in Python\
Trust is a function, and yours is all wrong\
\'97that was weird\
\
[Chorus]\
Snakes in the grass, I code in Python\
Fangs in the code, loyalty\'92s a bygone\
Printin\'92 red flags like it\'92s stderr\
But I still let you run like I didn\'92t care}
