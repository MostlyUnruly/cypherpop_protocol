[Intro]
They was never on the stack, now they poppin’ up — fake cache
Tried to fork my path, but I reroute fast — syntax clash

[Verse 1]
They smile in your @decorator, but snake in recursion
Act like they linked, but they break on each version
Tryna import love, but they missing the module
Had to raise exceptions — yeah, the vibe turned volatile
Venom in they bytes, tryna slither through my function
Said they down to ride, but ghosted at the junction
I stay threaded up, parallel in my precision
They just run loops — stuck in indecision

[Pre-Chorus]
You was just a try block, couldn’t catch the fall
Talkin’ loyalty, but your class too small
Wrapped in lies like a tuple in disguise
But I got eyes like print(traceback), no surprise

[Chorus]
Snakes in the grass, I code in Python
Fangs in the code, loyalty’s a bygone
Printin’ red flags like it’s stderr
But I still let you run like I didn’t care

[Verse 2]
def loyalty(): — yeah, you failed the test
-Now I del() that bond, clean up the mess
I don’t yield, I don’t bend, I assert my path
You a while True loop — all fake, no math

Swore you was static, but you acted dynamic
Changed on the fly, now the vibes feel manic
I got a blacklist longer than my Git commits
You was snake.charmer(), I was blind to the script
I debugged your whole persona — breakpoints everywhere
Steppin’ through your lies, saw NoneType in your stare
No scope, no depth, your code don’t even compile
Said you ride or die — but you raised ValueError

They try to clone the repo, but my soul ain’t open-source
You can pip install the drip, but you can’t run my course
I built this with venv — solo grind in silence
Now I chmod +x my trust — no compliance

[Bridge]
Snakes in the grass, but I shed that skin
New release, no bugs, let the real ones in
You was False, I was boolean strong
Now I raise LoyaltyError when the vibe feels wrong

[Pre Chorus]
Snakes in the grass — I code in Python
Trust is a function, and yours is all wrong
—that was weird

[Chorus]
Snakes in the grass, I code in Python
Fangs in the code, loyalty’s a bygone
Printin’ red flags like it’s stderr
But I still let you run like I didn’t care
