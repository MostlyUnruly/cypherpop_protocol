- `cyphernary.md` — living protocol lexicon of key terms and language
- `LICENSE` — MIT license for permissionless use and remix
- Versioning system: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH for track and doc evolution
- Markdown style guide for contributors

## [v1.0.1] – 2025-05-15

### Added
- `starter-kits/track-template.zip` — official starter folder for track contributions
- New `README.md` — full contributor onboarding and protocol usage guide
- Renamed original `README.md` to `MANIFESTO.md`
- Clarified markdown rendering issues and formatting best practices
- Added Cypherpop’s first musical release: **"Python v1.0.0 – dev"** in `tracks/python/`
- Updated folder structure to support scalable contribution (`tracks/`, `starter-kits/`, etc.)

### Improved

### Notes
This patch marks a milestone — the protocol’s first official track release and onboarding system.
