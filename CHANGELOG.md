# CHANGELOG

## [v1.0.0] - 2025-05-09

### Added
- Initial release of the Cypherpop Protocol
- `README.md` — core manifesto and enhanced methodology
- `whitepaper.md` — cultural protocol white paper v1.0
- `cyphernary.md` — living protocol lexicon of key terms and language
- `LICENSE` — MIT license for permissionless use and remix
- Versioning system: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH for track and doc evolution
- Markdown style guide for contributors
- Cultural doctrine: ethos, aesthetic logic, educational goals, and soft cyborg principles

### Notes
- This release establishes the foundational structure and documentation for Cypherpop.
- Treat this as the genesis block—intended to be forked, remixed, and iterated.

## [v1.0.1] – 2025-05-15

### Added
- `starter-kits/track-template.zip` — official starter folder for track contributions
- New `README.md` — full contributor onboarding and protocol usage guide
- Renamed original `README.md` to `MANIFESTO.md`
- Clarified markdown rendering issues and formatting best practices
- Added Cypherpop’s first musical release: **"Python v1.0.0 – dev"** in `tracks/python/`
- Updated folder structure to support scalable contribution (`tracks/`, `starter-kits/`, etc.)

### Improved
- README now includes file purpose table, track anatomy, and decentralized hosting instructions
- Markdown formatting stabilized across long code blocks
- `track.json` format clarified with sample fields and contributor tips

### Notes
This patch marks a milestone — the protocol’s first official track release and onboarding system.  
While no breaking changes were made to metadata schema, this version formalizes contributor flow and track registration standards.

## \[v1.0.2] – 2025-05-16

### Added

* `10_COMMITS.md` — Cypherpop’s ethic layer formally committed as 10 executable principles
* `PROTOCOL_PRIMER.md` — replaces legacy manifesto with a modular philosophy + methodology doc
* `starter-kits/submit.md` — simple protocol-aligned guide for submitting track folders via pull request

### Updated

* `README.md` — revised repo overview to reflect the 10 Commits, the protocol primer, and improved artist onboarding

### Notes

This version marks a structural upgrade: separating values, methods, and onboarding into focused, forkable documents.

It moves the protocol from declaration to documentation—without losing the rhythm.

Cypherpop is now more readable, remixable, and ready for commits.
