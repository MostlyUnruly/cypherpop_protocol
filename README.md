# CYPHERPOP MANIFEST v0.1.4

## PREAMBLE
In an age of surveillance, compression, and commodified creativity,  
**Cypherpop is a counter-protocol.**  
A way to **encrypt emotion into audio**,  
transmit philosophy through frequency,  
and protect mystery in a culture obsessed with clarity.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **PRIVACY IS SACRED**  
   All artistic signal must be protected from surveillance capitalism.  
   Music should not train models or feed metrics.  
   It should be a whisper passed hand to hand.

2. **CODE IS POETRY**  
   Syntax is rhythm. Logic is melody.  
   The compiler is our DAW.  
   A bug is just a lyric in draft form.

3. **DECENTRALIZE EVERYTHING**  
   No gatekeepers. No middlemen.  
   Peer-to-peer transmission of both signal and soul.  
   Own your masters. Host your nodes.

4. **ENCRYPTION AS EMOTION**  
   Our emotions are ciphertext.  
   If you don’t feel it, you don’t have the key.  
   Meaning is access-controlled.

5. **OPEN SOURCE CULTURE**  
   Share protocols, not just products.  
   Release stems. Fork ideas.  
   Credit your influences like you push commits.

6. **SOFT CYBORGS, HARD INTENTIONS**  
   We are biomechanical. Upgradable.  
   We wear Faraday bags and barefoot shoes.  
   Our aesthetics are armor. Our body is firmware.

7. **LOVE IS THE KERNEL**  
   Kindness is coded deep.  
   Do no harm—but don’t confuse love with passivity.  
   Protect children. Debug culture. Lead with intent.

## METHODOLOGY
Cypherpop is produced through a synthesis of:  
- Field recordings from digital infrastructure  
- Neural samples trained on archived emotion  
- Lyrics derived from both documentation and divine impulse  
- Traditional instruments reprocessed through cryptographic functions

## JOIN THE NETWORK
We are not just a genre.  
We are not an aesthetic.  
We are a protocol.  
We are not an industry.  
We are a resistance.
